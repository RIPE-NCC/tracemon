# Building

Install require.js and run:

npx r.js -o app.build.1.js  # generates dev/libs/jquery-libs.js
npx r.js -o app.build.2.js  # generates tracemon-dist.js
npx r.js -o app.build.3.js  # generates tracemon-core-dist.js

Only ES5 features are supported by the optimizer, so no arrow functions, const/let etc.
